## üåÄ Interactive Header Animation

The header uses a JavaScript Canvas animation for a mesmerizing effect:
- **50 RGB Lights**: Orbit the cursor/touch point with comet-like trails (10 positions, brightest at the head).
- **Ripples**: Click/tap to create expanding, fading ripples (opacity 0.7 to 0, max radius ~100vh).
- **Dynamic Year**: Header updates to "Booking Now for [current year + 1]" automatically.
- **Performance**: Optimized for smooth rendering, with `mix-blend-mode: overlay` for vibrant colors.

**Customize the animation** in the `<script>` block (~lines 210‚Äì300):
- Change light count: Adjust `for (let i = 0; i < 50; i++)` (e.g., to 30 for better performance).
- Modify ripple opacity: Set `opacity: 0.7` in `mousedown`/`touchstart` listeners.
- Adjust trail length: Change `light.trail.length > 10` to 5 or 15.
- Remove animation: Delete the `<canvas class="lights">` and `<script>` block for a static header.

## üîÄ For Other DJs

This template is built for you to remix!  
Fork the repo, swap in your details, and launch your own Wedding DJ landing page.

- **Keep the Hypnotic Header**: Retain the `<script>` and tweak colors, light count, or ripple effects.
- **Go Minimal**: Remove the `<canvas>` and `<script>` for a clean, static look.
- **Add Your Flair**: Update fonts, colors (e.g., `.cta-button` background `#ff6f61`), or add new sections.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

- **Animation Lag**: Reduce lights (`i < 50` to `i < 30`) or ripples (`ripples.length > 5` in `<script>`).
- **Images Not Loading**: Ensure images are in the `images/` folder and paths match in `index.html`.
- **Button Issues**: Verify CTA button (`z-index: 1`, `pointer-events: auto`) isn‚Äôt blocked by ripples. Add `if (!event.target.closest('.cta-button'))` to `mousedown`/`touchstart` listeners if needed.
- **Mobile Touch Issues**: Check `event.preventDefault()` in `touchmove`/`touchstart` doesn‚Äôt interfere with scrolling. Adjust if necessary.
