## 🌀 Interactive Header Animation

The header uses a JavaScript Canvas animation for a mesmerizing effect:
- 50 RGB lights orbit the cursor/touch point with comet-like trails.
- Click/tap to trigger expanding, fading ripples.
- Dynamic year: "Booking Now for [current year + 1]" updates automatically.

**Customize the animation** in `main.js`:
- Change light count, ripple opacity, and trail length.
- Remove animation by omitting the `<canvas>` and script references.
